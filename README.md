## Linux CLI, and HTTP
[Screenshots](task_linux_cli)
+ I have been using Linux for about a year, so I knew the basic commands.
+ I am surprised by the power and flexibility of the Linux CLI.
+ I intend to use in future - general commands, such as ls, cd, pwd, cat, curl etc.

## Git Collaboration

+ I learned a lot, learned about the rebase, cherry-pick

+ Thanks to the course, I learned some  new tags, pseudo-elements, selectors.

 measurement associated with the screen.
