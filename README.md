## Linux CLI, and HTTP
[Screenshots](task_linux_cli)
+ I have been using Linux for about a year, so I knew the basic commands.
+ I am surprised by the power and flexibility of the Linux CLI.
+ I intend to use in future - general commands, such as ls, cd, pwd, cat, curl etc.
---
## Git Collaboration
[Screenshots](task_git_collaboration)
+ I learned a lot, learned about the rebase, cherry-pick
+ I was surprised that deleting commits is very easy. I have often had problems with it.
+ I think that all the commands and tricks for me will be needed soon.

## Intro to HTML and CSS
[Screenshots](task_html_css_intro)
+ Thanks to the course, I learned some  new tags, pseudo-elements, selectors.
+ I didn't know how easy it is to do field validation.
+ I intend to use in future - attribute pattern and regular expressions for validation.

## Responsive Web Design
[Screenshots](task_responsive_web_design)
+ I learned more about the responsive layout. Learned more about the units of \
 measurement associated with the screen.
+ The flexibility and ease of use of flexbox surprised me, in most cases I use it.
+ I intend to use in future - flexbox, responsive design features, media queries.

## HTML & CSS Practice
[Code](https://github.com/evgenii-del/kottans-popup) | [Demo](http://vivacious-tooth.surge.sh/) reviewed @OleksiyRudenko
+ I learned a new pseudo-class :focus.
+ I was surprised that you can create a popup without using JS.
+ In the future, I will use the knowledge I received after the review from the mentors.
---
## JS Basics
[Screenshots](task_js_basics)
+ After completing the tasks at freecodecamp.org, I got a lot of experience.
+ I was surprised by the capabilities of ES6, the code looks clearer and simpler.
+ I am going to use all ES6 features in the future.
---
## DOM
[Screenshots](task_js_dom)
+ Keyboard and mouse events were new to me.
+ I was surprised by browser events.
+ I intend to use in future different methods and properties, such as createElement, \
 querySelector, remove(), .setAttribute().
